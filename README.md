1. Logic gates where each gate uses the previous implementation of gates going all the way back to the primitive nand gate
2/3. ALU and memory units using the logic gates from 1
4. Assembly programs for the Hack computer
5. CPU (capable of running assembly programs for 4) and RAM using the ALU and other memory units.
6. Assembler
7/8. Virtual machine
9. High level Java like language (called Jack)
