# A 16 bit computer, built completely from the groun up capable of running Tetris
all hardware and software components are built completely from scratch to fully learn and understand how computers work. The ultimate goal is to create a fully functional 16-bit computer capable of running Tetris, with every step documented.
## 1. Logic Gates/Boolean Logic
The foundation of any computer system is built on logic gates and boolean logic. In this phase, we construct a large collection of 1-bit and 16-bit logic gates from scratch.
Features
    - Basic Gates: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR
    - Composite Gates: Multiplexers, Demultiplexers, Adders, Subtractors
    - 16-bit Versions: Expanding 1-bit logic gates to operate on 16-bit data
## 2 - Boolean Arithmetic/ALU
  _ Arithmetic logic unit
  _ Mathmatical logic gates
## 3 - Memory
  _ Various sizes of RAM chips
  _ Clocked chips, DFFs
## 4 - Machine language
  _ Test programs written in the Hack flavor of Assembly
## 5 - CPU
  _ The Central processing unit
  _ All hardware into the computer chip
## 6 - Assembler
  _ An assembler to assemble the Hack machine language
## 7 - VM P1
  _ The first part of VM translation as part of a 2 step compilation process
  _ Handles basic VM bytecode and translates into machine code
